    CLEVELAND BROWNS

    <p>
        The franchise was founded in 1945 by Brown and businessman Arthur B. McBride as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC).
        The Browns dominated the AAFC, compiling a 47–4–3 record in the league's four seasons and winning its championship in each.[13]
        When the AAFC folded after the 1949 season, the Browns joined the NFL along with the San Francisco 49ers and the original Baltimore Colts.
        The team won a championship in their inaugural NFL season, as well as in the 1954, 1955, and 1964 seasons, and in a feat unequaled in any of the North American major professional sports,
        played in their league championship game in each of the Browns' first ten years of existence.
        From 1965 to 1995, they qualified to play in the NFL playoffs 14 times, but did not win another championship or play in the Super Bowl during that period.</p>

        NEW ORLEANS SAINTS
    </h4>

    <p>
        The Saints were among the NFL's least successful franchises in their first several decades, where they went 20 consecutive seasons without a winning record or qualifying for the playoffs.
        They earned their first winning record and postseason berth in 1987, while their first playoff win would not occur until 2000, their 34th season.
        The team's fortunes improved amid the 21st century, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders.
        Their greatest success was during the 2009 season when they won the franchise's first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XLIV, also their championship debut.
        The Saints are one of two NFL franchises to win their sole Super Bowl appearance, along with the New York Jets, and the most recent to do so.</p>

       PHILADELPHIA EAGLES

        The Eagles had a 13–3 record in 2017, including a nine-game winning streak. In a week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback
        Carson Wentz left the game with a torn ACL, and backup Nick Foles, who was re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season.
        Foles led the Eagles to the Superbowl with incredible performances,making fans forget about an MVP-caliber player as Wentz.In the Superbowl LII they faced
        Brady and the Patriots.They ended up winning 41-33 in a thrilling game that came down to the wire.That was their only Superbowl win in their history</p>
